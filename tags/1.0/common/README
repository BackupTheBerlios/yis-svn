Yoper Installer Coding How-To
==============================

Hi all, its nice to be with the Yoper Team and work with them. So now, am here with YIS (Yoper Installer) How-To which would prepare you how to start coding the YIS.

Requirements
============

1) Qt >= 3.3.* but not Qt 4
2) PyQt - cross verify whether you have the correct PyQt version for Qt version you have
	for eg., For Qt 3.3.4 , you have to download the corresponding version of PyQt
3) Python >= 2.4.1
4) Qt Designer 3.3.*

Files that come make YIS (As of 04/11/05)
========================

1) yos-installer.ui
2) InstallerUI.py
3) Main.py
4) YoperInstaller.py
5) Disclaimer.py
6) Makefile
7) run-once

	Description
	===========
	1) InstallerUI.py is an Autogenerated python module from yos-installer.ui
	   This job is done by the PyQt User Interface compiler "pyuic". You cannot do any
	   changes to this InstallerUI.py.Any changes done to yos-installer.ui would reflect here.

	2) Main.py is the "main()" for us.We start from this file.This is responsible for our
	   application to run.We create the Main Qt Application object here.

	3) YoperInstaller.py is the Main GUI file holding the access to Interface.From here we can
	   make modifications to each screen in Installer.

	4) Disclaimer.py holds methods and attributes corresponding to Disclaimer Screen. We call this
	   YoperInstaller.py and initialize the default values and connect signals and slots.It is 
	   nothing but a python module.

	5) run-once is just a script file which makes your work easier by issuing compiling options.

The Flow
=========

				   pyuic
		yos-installer.ui --------->InstallerUi.py

				Main.py
				  ||
				  ||
			    YoperInstaller.py
				  ||
				  ||
			||		||		||
		  Disclaimer.py	     Network.py	      Bootloader.py ....

Now i think coding has been simpliefied. By having separate python modules for each screen, our jobs  makes it easier and anybody adding a screen will not affect the coding part also.
